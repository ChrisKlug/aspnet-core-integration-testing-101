# ASP.NET Core API Integration Testing Demo

This repo contains the code used in my presentation "ASP.NET Core Integration Testing 101".

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, or at least run the tests, you just need to clone the repo. Update the connectionstring in the [appsettings.IntegrationTesting.json](./Demo.AspNet.IntegrationTesting.Api/appsettings.IntegrationTesting.json) file and open it in Visual Studio or VS Code and run the tests using the Test Explorer.
